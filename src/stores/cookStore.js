Here vinegar is used as a marinade; you can use any other marinade for kebab. Take table vinegar, 9%. Spices - any for meat or barbecue. You can cook meat with or without skewers.",

          "Place the meat in a bowl, pour table vinegar into it. Mix well. Add chopped onion, salt and season to taste. I only used ground black pepper. If you have a set of spices for barbecue, be sure to check if it contains salt so as not to oversalt the meat. Mix everything again, cover the bowl and put it in the refrigerator for 4-8 hours. The longer the meat is marinated, the tastier the kebab will be.",
          "Thread the marinated meat onto wooden skewers and place onion rings between the pieces.",
          "Turn on the multicooker to the “Frying” or “Baking” mode, depending on your model. The time, if set, is set to 40 minutes. Pour in a little vegetable oil and wait until it warms up. Place skewers with meat in a bowl. If they don't fit, cut off the ends. I broke one kebab in half so as not to lose space. If you fry without skewers, simply place the meat and onions in a bowl of heated oil.",
          "Fry the meat for 15 minutes on each side until golden brown. It is better not to close the lid at the very beginning so that the juice does not escape from the meat. I did this at the very end, when the kebab was all fried, to bring it to readiness. Simply fry the meat without skewers, stirring, also without a lid at the beginning. The exact cooking time depends on the selected mode and operating features of your multicooker. Read more about this in the article at the link at the end of the recipe.",
